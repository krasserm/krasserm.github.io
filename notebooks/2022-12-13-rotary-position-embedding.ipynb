    "# A gentle introduction to Rotary Position Embedding\n",

    "The [Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) model is invariant to reordering of the input sequence. For sequence modeling, position information must therefore be explicitly included. [Rotary position embedding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.09864) is an approach for including relative position information. It is a multiplicative approach, in contrast to most other approaches which are additive.\n",

    "The diagonal of the attention matrix $\\mathbf{A}$, where $n - m = 0$, contains the inner products of non-rotated queries and keys and therefore doesn't encode relative position information. For off-diagonal elements, where $n - m \\neq 0$, the inner product decays with increasing distance. A proof for an upper bound of the decay is given in section 3.4.3 of the rotary position encoding paper. This supports the intuition that tokens with larger distance have weaker connection than tokens with smaller distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rotary position embedding is also compatible with [linear self-attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.16236) which is a kernel-based method that avoids explicitly computing the attention matrix. Other approaches for relative position encoding that directly operate on the attention matrix can't therefore be used. Rotary position embedding on the other hand derives relative position information from rotated queries and keys alone without adding values to the attention matrix directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another property of rotary position embedding is the flexibility to sequence length. Although not discussed in the paper I think it is because relative position information can be generated with a predefined function for any values of $m$ and $n$.\n",
