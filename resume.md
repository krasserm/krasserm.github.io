# Martin Krasser

I'm a self-employed software engineer and architect with a focus on machine learning, data-intensive applications and
distributed systems. I support customers in their AI projects from a scientific, engineering and management perspective.
I'm a continuous learner, passionate about technology and contributor to several open source projects.
