# Martin Krasser

I'm a freelance software engineer with a strong background in machine learning, distributed systems, event sourcing and system integration. My current focus is on AI search engines and agentic systems. I support customers in all phases of their machine learning projects, from initial research, prototyping, iterative solution development up to serving and maintaining machine learning solutions in production. My experience as distributed systems engineer comes from the development of numerous large-scale event-driven systems, including globally distributed systems that provide causal consistency guarantees. Iâ€™m a continuous learner and active open source contributor.
