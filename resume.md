I'm a passionate software engineer and architect with 20 years industry experience. I primarily work on distributed 
systems, system integration, event sourcing, event stream processing and machine learning, including deep learning. 
I have experience with all phases of the software development lifecycle and with working in leadership roles. I'm a 
continuous learner and contributor to several open source projects. I enjoy working in teams and helping others to 
work more effectively.
