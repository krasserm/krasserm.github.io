I'm a data scientist and software engineer with a focus on machine learning and distributed systems. I have a strong 
interest in machine learning theory and in developing machine learning solutions that run reliably in production and 
are maintainable. I'm passionate about technology, a continuous learner and a contributor to several open source 
projects. I enjoy working in teams and helping others to meet project goals more effectively.
