# Martin Krasser

I'm a freelance machine learning engineer and software developer. I support customers in all phases of their machine 
learning projects, from initial research, prototyping, iterative solution development up to serving and maintaining machine 
learning solutions in production environments. Current focus is on deep learning for computer vision and natural language 
processing, mainly in context of multimodal neural search engines. I also have a special interest in Bayesian methods 
for machine learning. My experience as distributed systems engineer comes from the development of numerous large-scale
event-driven systems, including globally distributed systems that provide causal consistency guarantees. I'm a continuous 
learner and contributor to several open source projects.
